Student Union Management – Brief Notes

Security
	•	Students name, email and student id should be stored securely using encryption.
	•	Data which is sensitive should only be allowed to be accessed by authorised users.

⸻

Performance
	•	Registration pages for students should load quickly and efficiently.
	•	Create better more efficient optimised code to reduce load time on the data base.

⸻

Reliability
	•	The registration should be backed up ensuring no data loss.
	•	Should alert the user if registration is successful or not immediately.

⸻

Scalability
	•	Data base should allow students names to be stored in society or events they have signed up for without delay or slowing down.
	•	Would need to allow thousands of student to register whilst allowing officer to modify data.
	•	Allow students name to be linked and connected to multiple societies clubs or events the student takes part in.

Where do I add this? This is all I’ve done so far just notes and stuff for section 2 and so we have something for weekly meeting notes
